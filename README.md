This bot can manage nation roles in discord, ** and for this it can use only online map!**
<h1>First step</h1>
Create a bot in discord, make invite link for him. Invite that bot as administrator in your discord server.

<h1>Second step</h1>
Configure file config.yaml.
In <code>url</code> field put a url where we can get JSON of map, for example: <code>https://map1.minetown.ru/up/world/world/</code>
In <code>bot_token</code> field put the token of your discord bot, it looks like: <code>ODc1NzMwNjDFSczMwNDU2NjA3.YRZxtg.tUv4xAkwdOtx8SQ4jaoBRH3MZDg</code>
